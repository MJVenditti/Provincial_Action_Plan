  <h2>The Idea</h2>
  <p>My idea furthers Ontario’s commitment to modernizing Service Ontario by incorporating most services and the latest Provincial regulations into one responsive and personalized application to better serve Ontarians. The specific short-term goal of the application is to encourage Ontarians to safety access government-funded initiatives and services while also being a highly responsive tool that can be further utilized in a post-covid environment. The application provides the Government of Ontario the ability to send personalized notifications and alerts based on a user’s profile. This ensures that those who should access the available services or meet funding criteria can do so in a timely manner with minimal barriers from a safe environment. Those who are not able to utilize the application will notice a reduction in overall wait times for the services they require. The application’s tools will be available to use at all hours of the day to accommodate everyone’s schedule. Convenience also drives engagement from Ontarians. This engagement can be fully utilized with a built-in survey tool that allows the Ontario Government to remain accountable, innovative, and inclusive. By using this application, the people are providing the Government with an ongoing database of information that can be cross-referenced at any time. This can be useful for approving small business loans, student grants to further one’s education, and notify individuals of new initiatives that they are eligible to participate in. This application is designed to empower the people of Ontario by keeping them informed of the latest information that applies directly to them.

<div class="text" id="phase_2">
  <h2>The Research and Intended Impact</h2>
  <p>To accurately analyze the application’s impact, we must first consider who might use this application. I can predict that the user will be a resident of Ontario, comfortable using technology, owns a smartphone, may not have reasonable access to transportation or is unable to access a private desktop computer. For those who are able to utilize the application effectively, it will encourage their absence from Service Ontario locations and allow them to conduct all business from a remote location. It will also eliminate any travel costs and emissions that may be incurred. It will also provide a consistent link to government services with option of connecting over broadband internet or cellular data. Finally and most significantly, it will enable Ontarians to remain informed of the services and funding they are eligible to claim. Therefore, we can predict that the Government will see an increase in approved business loans, post-secondary enrolment and application rates, and begin to foster partnerships with other sectors with features such as users being able to authorize a partner sign-in with financial institution credentials.

<!--   Jumbotron Phase 3   -->

<div class="text" id="phase_3">
  <h2>Preventative Measures</h2>
  <p>Acting as a portal to resources, it is crucial to keep the links as updated as possible. One foreseeable risk is publishing an incorrect link and misdirecting the user. This can be mitigated with diligent, multi-stage reviews through programs like GitHub. Once approved, the code can be published and pushed to a public update. Another risk is the confusion pertaining to which level of government handles the area in question for the user. Simple error prevention pages like directing users to municipal or federal resources by identifying keywords in their search is a potential solution. This will greatly reduce any friction between the user and the application and promote further engagements.

    <h1 class="jumbo_title">KPIs</h1>
    <p class="jumbo_lead">To measure the success of the application, we can consider the number of partner accounts linked such as financial or post-secondary institutions and note the current overall wait times at Service Ontario locations. For this idea to be considered successful, the Government of Ontario must see an increase in partner accounts linked and a reduction in the average wait time in Service Ontario locations.</p>
